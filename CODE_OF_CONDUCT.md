# Code of Conduct

## Our Vibe

We are all here to contribute, collaborate, and have a good time. Let’s keep things friendly, respectful, and drama-free for everyone involved.

## How We Roll

**Do:**
- Be welcoming and inclusive.
- Respect different opinions; we’re all learning.
- Take feedback on the chin and use it to improve.
- Keep the community’s best interests at heart.

**Don’t:**
- Harass, troll, or throw shade at anyone.
- Share someone’s personal info without their say-so.

## Keeping Things in Check

If something’s not right, the project maintainers will sort it out. Need to flag something? Just drop a message to the maintainer listed in `pyproject.toml`.

## Shout-out

Inspired by the Contributor Covenant, but with a bit more chill.
